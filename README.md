# Fello

Last semester I asked my professor for some extra projects to challenge myself beyond what we had learned and he gave me the following:

This repo is dedicated to the first project in that list which I am calling "Fello". I am working on this as part of a #30DaysofCode Challenge set up for our NSBE-SHPE chapter at Lehman College.

The goal of the program is to replace a word in a text file with another word and I was able to accomplish that simply using the ```File``` and ```Scanner``` classes along with the ```.replaceAll``` method with a regex switch. 

The second iteration I am working on will be to create a GUI and accept a text file from a user along with a word they would like to replace in the file and the word they would like to replace it with. The program will output the resulting text file. 
It will be a more complicated version of "find and replace" in any text editor. Learning for learning's sake! 

I'll date the specific updates here. In the meantime, check out my progress on my blog: ![https://seerocode.github.io/](https://seerocode.github.io/)
